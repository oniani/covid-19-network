# covid-19-network

We constructed network embeddings for COVID-19 by applying the node2vec model
over a co-occurrence network derived from the [CORD-19-on-FHIR](https://github.com/fhircat/CORD-19-on-FHIR)
dataset.

Additional code can be found at [covid-19-network-embeddings](https://github.com/shenfc/COVID-19-network-embeddings).

## Paper

Our work has been published at [Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association (JAMIA)](https://academic.oup.com/jamia)
